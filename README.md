# LPWasteClassification
Embedded AI Project (mwe2109 ady2113)

This project is a solar-powered recycling/waste classifier using a Coral Dev Board Micro

This repository is separated into three categories:
1. C++ code for the Coral Dev Board Micro
2. Jupyter Notebook used for retraining the MobileNet V2 model
3. CAD files for the enclosure (Inventor format) along with a list of all materials used in the project

Supplemental code to build these files is available upon request, but not included here as it is not relevant to the functionality of the project.
